## 1. Snapshot
- Certification governed by Principles & Requirements; project cycle includes Gold Standard Certified Project Design and Gold Standard Certified Project, with optional product labels (Principles §2.1–2.3).
- Land-use eligibility guided by LUF Activity Requirements, Positive List of approved practices, and smallholder definitions; A/R methodology provides quantification rules for carbon sequestration projects (LUF §1–§4; Positive List; Smallholder).
- Impact Registry records issuance/retirement of Gold Standard Verified Emission Reductions (GSVERs), Planned Emission Reductions (PERs), and Article 6 authorisations (GHG PR §§10–15).

## 2. Carbon Accounting Protocols
- Governance: Gold Standard Foundation oversees certification; Principles & Requirements set global rules; Impact Registry manages issuance and Article 6 authorisations. *(Principles §2; Program Guide references)*
- Project eligibility requires defined area, legal compliance, uncontested rights, and avoidance of double counting. *(Principles §3.1)*
- Land-use specifics governed by LUF Activity Requirements, positive lists, and smallholder definitions; A/R methodology outlines scope and applicability. *(LUF §§1–2; Positive List; Smallholder §2; Methodology §2.1)*
- Baseline scenarios compare reasonable alternatives, including suppressed demand rules for small-scale projects; additionality requires demonstration via UNFCCC/GS tools and financial need tests. *(Principles §4.1.8–§4.1.16; §4.1.46–§4.1.48; Methodology §3.2)*
- Project documentation must map baseline/project scenarios, SDG contributions, and monitoring indicators. *(Principles §4.1.12–§4.1.15; §4.1.40)*

## 3. Certificates
- GSVERs issued post-verification; PERs (ex-ante) allowed for LUF projects (≤5 years) and agriculture (≤3 years) with 20 % buffer withholding and conversion after performance certification. *(GHG PR §§11.1–§11.2)*
- Impact Registry manages serials, authorisations, and labels; dual certification permitted only with explicit Gold Standard approval to prevent double counting. *(Principles §2.3; GHG PR §10.1.2)*
- Projects operating under other programs must ensure aggregated crediting periods do not exceed Gold Standard limits; pre-CDM issuance requires surrender commitments. *(GHG PR §§10.1.2, 10.7.1)*
- Positive List enumerates eligible activities; smallholder definitions unlock tailored rules; stacking allowed under compatibility checks. *(Positive List; Smallholder §2; Principles §2.3)*

## 4. Carbon Reduction Confidence
- Monitoring plans validated at design must specify parameters, frequency, responsible parties, ethics, and QA/QC approaches; annual monitoring reports underpin verifications. *(Principles §4.1.40–§4.1.45; GHG PR §10.3)*
- A/R methodology quantifies sequestration by modelling units, deducting baseline and leakage upfront (t=1) and tracking annual CO2 removals; remote sensing classification must reach >=90 % accuracy. *(Methodology §§3.3–§3.7; Annex C §1.1.6)*
- Compliance buffer requires 20 % of sequestration components; carbon performance checks compare stocks vs issued PERs/GSVERs and define remedial actions. *(GHG PR §§11.1, 11.4)*
- PER issuance prior to verification, soil carbon optional modules, and buffer safeguards manage permanence risk; reversals handled via Performance Shortfall Guidelines. *(GHG PR §§11.1–11.4)*
- Materiality, uncertainty, and QA guidance captured in Methodology/GHG PR; projects must justify default factors, sampling, and inventory accuracy. *(Methodology §§3.5–3.7; Annex C; GHG PR §10)*
- Leakage deductions applied in year 1 for activity categories (fuelwood, timber, agriculture, livestock) with optional default factors; compliance buffer addresses residual risk. *(Methodology §3.7; GHG PR §§10.1–10.4)*

## 5. Non-Carbon Metrics
- Safeguarding framework covers human rights, gender equality, labour conditions, biodiversity, pollution, cultural heritage, indigenous/customary rights, and conflict sensitivity; projects must assess risks, document mitigation, and provide evidence. *(Safeguards §§4–5)*
- Gender requirements mandate gender-responsive assessments, equal participation, and reporting on gender indicators linked to selected SDGs. *(Gender §§2.1–2.4)*
- Stakeholder consultation follows two formal rounds plus continuous grievance mechanism; FPIC required where rights may be affected. *(Stakeholder §§3.1–3.8)*
- Projects may earn price premiums or labels for co-benefits via SDG Impact tools and certified safeguards. *(GHG PR §§10–11; GS SDG tools)*

## 6. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- 2024/2025 updates reinforce SDG alignment, financial additionality, expanded safeguarding, and Article 6 reporting; GHG Product Requirements v3.0 formalise 20 % buffer and Impact Registry authorisation workflows.
- Workshop prompts: How does Gold Standard’s dual requirement for SDG impacts and financial additionality influence project credibility? Do suppressed-demand baselines risk over-crediting? What governance challenges arise from multi-program certification (GSVERs + labels)?
