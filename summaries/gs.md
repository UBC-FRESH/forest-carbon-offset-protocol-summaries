## 1. Snapshot
- Certification governed by Principles & Requirements; project cycle includes Gold Standard Certified Project Design and Gold Standard Certified Project, with optional product labels (Principles §2.1–2.3).
- Land-use eligibility guided by LUF Activity Requirements, Positive List of approved practices, and smallholder definitions; A/R methodology provides quantification rules for carbon sequestration projects (LUF §1–§4; Positive List; Smallholder).
- Impact Registry records issuance/retirement of Gold Standard Verified Emission Reductions (GSVERs), Planned Emission Reductions (PERs), and Article 6 authorisations (GHG PR §§10–15).

## 2. Governance & Protocol Setting
- Gold Standard Foundation oversees certification, maintains the Impact Registry, and approves dual/stacked certification to avoid double counting (Principles §3.1.1; GHG PR §§10.1.2, 10.7).
- Eligibility requires defined project boundaries, legal compliance, uncontested ownership, host-country law adherence, and transparency on Official Development Assistance (Principles §3.1.1(a–h)).
- LUF projects submit detailed GIS layers, socio-economic context, and risk assessment covering land-use history, stakeholder profiles, and project change risks (LUF §4.1.3; §4.1.2 bullets).
- Impact Registry terms govern account access, serial tracking, and Article 6 authorisations; false or duplicate claims can trigger suspension (GHG PR §§10–14).

## 3. Baseline & Additionality Rules
- Projects define conservative baseline and project scenarios considering legal enforcement; suppressed demand baselines limited to eligible small-scale contexts (Principles §4.1.8–4.1.10).
- Projects must document contributions to at least three SDGs (including SDG 13) and identify monitoring indicators at design stage (Principles §4.1.12–4.1.16).
- Financial additionality is required for product issuance: apply UNFCCC/GS additionality tools (CDM Tool 01/21, etc.), demonstrate regulatory surplus, and show carbon finance necessity (Principles §§4.1.46–4.1.48; Methodology §3.2.2–3.2.3).
- LUF requirements emphasise baseline land-use assessment, modelling unit definition, and eligibility verification (LUF §4.1; Methodology §§2.1–3.5).

## 4. Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)
- Monitoring plan (validated at design) must specify parameters, frequency, data collection methods, responsible parties, QA/QC, and ethical considerations (Principles §§4.1.40–4.1.45).
- A/R methodology quantifies sequestration by modelling units, deducting baseline and leakage upfront (t=1) and tracking annual CO2 removals; remote sensing classification must reach >=90 % accuracy (Methodology §§3.3–3.7; Annex C §1.1.6).
- GHG Product Requirements set default crediting periods (max 10 years absent activity-specific rules), retroactive crediting limits (2 years, or 3 years for A/R/AGR), and require verification before Impact Registry issuance (GHG PR §§10.1–10.4).
- Performance Certification cross-checks monitored carbon stocks vs issued PERs/GSVERs; deviations trigger reporting within 30 days and corrective actions (GHG PR §11.4.1).

## 5. Credit Issuance & Registries
- GSVERs issued post-verification; PERs (ex-ante) allowed for LUF projects up to 5 years (3 years for agriculture) with 20 % buffer withholding and conversion to GSVERs after verification (GHG PR §§11.1–11.2).
- Impact Registry manages serials, authorisations, and claims; dual certification permitted only with explicit Gold Standard approval to prevent double crediting (Principles §2.3; GHG PR §10.1.2).
- Projects operating under other programs must ensure combined crediting periods do not exceed Gold Standard limits; pre-CDM GSVER issuance requires surrender commitments (GHG PR §§10.1.2, 10.7.1).

## 6. Eligible Activities & Credit Use
- Project types must align with approved Activity Requirements or secure approval; fossil fuel, nuclear, and geo-engineering projects are excluded (Principles §4.1.7).
- Positive List enumerates eligible A/R practices (e.g., assisted natural regeneration, agroforestry); smallholder definition (<25 ha or <25 % income from agriculture) unlocks tailored requirements and default factors (Positive List; Smallholder §2).
- Stacking (combining products) is permitted under defined conditions, provided baselines and impacts are compatible and double counting is avoided (Principles §2.3; §4.1.11).

## 7. Safeguards & Co-benefits
- Safeguarding framework covers human rights, gender equality, labour safety, biodiversity, pollution, cultural heritage, indigenous/customary rights, and conflict sensitivity; projects must assess risks, document mitigation, and provide supporting evidence (Safeguards §§4–5; Annex).
- Gender requirements mandate gender-responsive assessments, equal participation, and reporting on gender indicators linked to selected SDGs (Gender §§2.1–2.4).
- Stakeholder consultation entails at least two formal meetings (Local Stakeholder Consultation I & II), public comment periods, and documentation of responses; continuous input & grievance mechanism must remain active through the crediting period (Stakeholder §§3.1–3.8; LUF Annex D).
- FPIC is required where land/resource rights are affected; stakeholder lists, contact records, and updates are included in each monitoring report (Stakeholder §§3.5–3.8; Principles §3.1.1(f)).

## 8. Permanence & Reversal Management
- LUF projects contribute 20 % of sequestration-related PERs/GSVERs to the Compliance Buffer; contribution not required for purely avoidance projects (GHG PR §11.1.1).
- Carbon Performance provisions require tracking actual stocks vs issued credits, reporting incidents within 30 days, and following Performance Shortfall Guidelines when shortfalls occur (GHG PR §11.4.1).
- LUF requirements enforce riparian buffer zones (15 m), mosaic planting, conservation set-asides, and documentation of land-use history to mitigate reversal risks (LUF §§4.1, 7.2, Annexes).

## 9. Materiality & Data Quality
- Monitoring plan mandates QA/QC and ethical data handling; SDG indicators tie to national/international datasets or justified proxy metrics (Principles §§4.1.15–4.1.16; §4.1.40).
- Remote sensing classifications for eligibility require >=90 % accuracy and documentation of sensors, methods, and ground-truthing (Methodology Annex C §1.1.4–1.1.7).
- Impact Registry oversight and Terms of Use enforce accurate reporting; breaches can suspend account access and de-label credits (GHG PR §§13–14).

## 10. Leakage Assessment & Mitigation
- A/R methodology addresses leakage via four activity categories (fuelwood, timber, agriculture, livestock) with deductions applied in year 1 using activity-shift percentages and CO2-stock estimates (Methodology §§3.7.1–3.7.8).
- LUF requirements integrate socio-economic assessments, land-use planning, and buffer/mosaic design to minimise displacement risks (LUF §§4.1.2, 7.2, 12).

## 11. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- 2024/2025 updates reinforce SDG alignment, financial additionality, expanded safeguarding, and Article 6 reporting; GHG Product Requirements v3.0 formalise 20 % buffer and Impact Registry authorisation workflows.
- Workshop prompts: How does Gold Standard’s dual requirement for SDG impacts and financial additionality influence project credibility? Compare the 20 % compliance buffer and carbon performance checks with VCS/CAR permanence mechanisms. Evaluate stakeholder consultation depth relative to other standards when crafting “good” vs “bad” protocols.
