# Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) — Summary

*Reference shorthand: “VCS Standard §X” denotes clauses in the VCS Standard v4.7 (16 Apr 2024); “Program Guide §X” references the VCS Program Guide v4.4 (29 Aug 2023); “Reg/Issuance §Step Y” references the Registration & Issuance Process v4.6 (16 Oct 2024); “NPRT §X” references the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool v4.2 (3 May 2024).*

## 1. Snapshot
- Global program administered by Verra covering the seven Kyoto gases plus ODS; eligible projects apply VCS-approved or adopted methodologies within defined scope exclusions. *(VCS Standard §2.1)*
- AFOLU project categories include ARR, ALM, IFM, REDD, ACoGS, and WRC; non-AFOLU activities span energy, industrial, waste, and other sectors subject to scope limitations in non-LDC contexts. *(VCS Standard Appendix 1; §2.1.3)*
- Core document suite: VCS Standard, Program Guide (governance, registry), Registration & Issuance Process (project cycle), and supporting tools (e.g., AFOLU NPRT). *(Program Guide Contents; Reg/Issuance §Step 1–7)*

## 2. Carbon Accounting Protocols
- Verra (independent non-profit) manages the program, maintains impartiality, oversees VVBs, and administers the Verra Registry. *(Program Guide §2.5.4–§2.5.6)*
- Roles: project proponents control implementation and documentation; methodology developers follow the Methodology Development & Review Process; accredited VVBs validate/verify within approved sector scopes. *(Program Guide §2.5.1–§2.5.3; §7.1–§7.3)*
- Registry operations include account management, buffer credit tracking, fee collection, and liability provisions; complaints/appeals are codified. *(Program Guide §4.0–§4.2; §9)*
- Registration & issuance follow a seven-step workflow from validation through periodic issuance, retirement/cancellation, and ongoing maintenance reviews. *(Reg/Issuance §Step 1–7)*
- Baselines must follow applied methodology requirements, demonstrate equivalence of services, use conservative assumptions, and integrate applicable regulations or policies. *(VCS Standard §3.13.1–§3.13.4)*
- Additionality requires regulatory surplus at validation and each crediting period renewal; methodologies or approved activity modules (positive lists) provide tests, with safeguards when simplified approaches originate from other programs. *(VCS Standard §3.14.1–§3.14.2)*
- Project start/validation timing governed by listing, public comment, and deadline rules; AFOLU crediting periods span 20–100 years (renewable up to 100 years total) with reassessment of baseline/regulatory conditions at renewal. *(VCS Standard §3.8; §3.9.3–§3.9.9)*

## 3. Certificates
- VCUs are issued only after successful verification and Verra registration review; Verra deposits calculated buffer credits to pooled accounts before credit issuance. *(VCS Standard §2.3.1; §3.15.16; Reg/Issuance §Step 3–5)*
- Project proponents sign unilateral representations, and registry terms of use prohibit double selling; registry tracks serial numbers, retirements, cancellations, and pooled buffer balances. *(Program Guide §2.5.1; §4.0; VCS Standard §3.23.1–§3.23.6)*
- Fees and liability/time limits are defined in Program Guide; VCUs retain permanence even if projects later experience reversals (buffer credits cover losses). *(Program Guide §4.1–§4.2; VCS Standard §2.4.1)*
- Scope excludes certain grid-connected renewable and fossil energy efficiency activities in non-LDCs unless specific conditions are met; AFOLU activities must align with Appendix 1 definitions. *(VCS Standard §2.1.3; Appendix 1)*
- Projects cannot receive credit simultaneously under VCS and another GHG program; detailed gap validation requirements apply for transitions from programs such as CAR, CDM, or JI. *(VCS Standard §3.23.1–§3.23.13)*
- VCUs can carry labels (e.g., CCB, SD VISta) to communicate co-certifications; Program Guide outlines registry processes and fees. *(VCS Standard §3.24; Program Guide §4.1)*

## 4. Carbon Reduction Confidence
- Projects must maintain a GHG information system, QA/QC procedures, calibrated measurement equipment, and monitor leakage per methodology. *(VCS Standard §3.16.1–§3.16.5; §3.15.15)*
- Verification requires reasonable assurance with materiality thresholds of 5 % (1 % for large projects), mandated site visits at validation, first verification, baseline reassessment, and major deviations; VVBs evaluate responses to public comments prior to issuing conclusions. *(VCS Standard §4.1.10–§4.1.14; §3.18.13)*
- Monitoring reports follow Verra templates and feed into periodic verification; VVBs apply ISO 14065 competence requirements and document rationale when site visits are deferred. *(VCS Standard §4.1.19; Reg/Issuance §Step 1)*
- AFOLU projects must run the AFOLU NPRT to determine non-permanence risk; internal, external, and natural risk scores are summed, with minimum overall rating 12 and maximum 60. *(NPRT §2.5.1–§2.5.3)*
- The overall risk percentage equals the fraction of carbon stock increase deposited as buffer credits; category thresholds (internal <=35, external <=20, natural <=35) ensure risk diversification, and projects exceeding limits must mitigate risks before eligibility. *(NPRT §2.5.2–§2.5.4)*
- Verra periodically reconciles pooled buffer accounts and can adjust risk criteria prospectively; buffer cancellations compensate for verified reversals so issued VCUs remain intact. *(VCS Standard §2.4.1–§2.4.3; §3.15.16)*
- Verifications apply 5 % (1 %) aggregate materiality thresholds; VVBs must log rationale when site visits are waived, evaluate stakeholder input, and ensure methodology deviations do not undermine conservativeness. *(VCS Standard §4.1.10–§4.1.16; §3.20)*
- Monitoring plans require QA/QC procedures, calibrated instruments, documented data sources, and justification of any optional leakage deductions or methodology updates. *(VCS Standard §3.16.1–§3.16.5; §3.15.8–§3.15.15)*
- Leakage must be documented in project design and monitoring; IFM activities can apply default market leakage discounts (0–70 %) depending on harvest displacement, with optional 15 % activity-shifting and 10 % market deductions under defined conditions. *(VCS Standard §3.15.8–§3.15.15; Table 3)*
- International leakage (outside host country) need not be quantified, but projects cannot claim positive leakage; Verra reviews leakage assessments periodically for consistency. *(VCS Standard §3.15.11–§3.15.14; §2.5.1)*

## 5. Non-Carbon Metrics
- Projects must demonstrate contributions to at least three SDGs by the end of first monitoring period and each subsequent period; CCB or SD VISta verifications can satisfy this requirement. *(VCS Standard §3.17.1–§3.17.2)*
- Stakeholder engagement requires inclusive identification, pre-implementation consultation covering risks, benefit sharing, FPIC, and workers’ rights, with documentation of actions taken in response. *(VCS Standard §3.18.1–§3.18.3)*
- Grievance redress involves staged resolution (negotiation → mediation → arbitration/courts) and ongoing communication obligations before each validation/verification. *(VCS Standard §3.18.4–§3.18.6)*
- Extensive safeguards address community safety, labor rights (including gender equity, equal pay, prohibition of forced/child labor), indigenous/customary rights, cultural heritage, property rights, benefit sharing, biodiversity protection, and limits on ecosystem conversion. *(VCS Standard §3.19.1–§3.19.29)*

## 6. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- v4.7 updates consolidate expanded safeguard language (FPIC, gender, biodiversity), clarify acceptable use of non-native species where consistency with safeguards is demonstrated, and align AFOLU risk/leakage oversight with the latest NPRT. *(VCS Standard Document History notes §4364–4400)*
- Discussion starters: How do long AFOLU crediting periods and buffer contributions shape perceived permanence risk relative to other protocols? What implementation burden does the SDG contribution requirement create for projects targeting compliance vs voluntary buyers? How do VCS leakage discounts compare with jurisdictional approaches (e.g., CAR or BC FCOP) when groups design “good” versus “bad” protocols?
