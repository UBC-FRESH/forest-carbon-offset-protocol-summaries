# B.C. Forest Carbon Offset Protocol (FCOP) — Summary

*Reference shorthand: “BC FCOP §X” denotes sections of the 2024 Forest Carbon Offset Protocol (Version 2, April 18 2024).*

## 1. Snapshot
- Issued by the Director under Section 10 of the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act; Version 2 effective 18 April 2024. *(BC FCOP cover; §1.0)*
- Applies to forest carbon projects in British Columbia that meet the Emission Offset Project Regulation (EOPR) and protocol rules. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*
- Eligible project types: Afforestation/Reforestation (AFF/REF), Conservation & Improved Forest Management (CONS/IFM), Avoided Conversion (AC). *(BC FCOP §3.3)*

## 2. Carbon Accounting Protocols
- Legally binding requirements for project proponents, validation bodies, and verification bodies; protocol supplements EOPR and must be read alongside it. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*
- Director accepts project plans, issues offset units, and may withhold issuances if reporting obligations are outstanding. *(BC FCOP §3.4, §3.7, §8.4.3)*
- Project proponents must comply with other provincial statutes (e.g., Forests Act, Professional Governance Act) and maintain records per EOPR. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*
- Indigenous engagement is mandatory: proponents must notify, meet, share information with, and report back to Applicable First Nations; ongoing engagement throughout the crediting period is expected. *(BC FCOP §3.1.6)*
- Baseline determination uses two pathways:
  - Performance Standard (mandatory for AFF/REF on public land): choose regulatory, historic practice, or hybrid scenario, selecting the most conservative option. *(BC FCOP §5.1)*
  - Project-Specific (default for other cases): identify all plausible scenarios, evaluate 20-year historic data, assess financial/legal/technical obstacles, and evidence candidate viability. *(BC FCOP §5.2)*
- Additionality assertions cover both financial need (revenues from offsets required to proceed) and regulatory additionality (activities exceed existing or new requirements); reconfirmed in each project report. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §6.1–§6.2)*
- Project reductions cannot be claimed in other offset systems and cannot receive per-tonne incentive funding. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §6.2)*

## 3. Certificates
- Default crediting period is 25 years from project start (shorter optional), with potential revalidation at expiry; monitoring obligations run 100 years beyond crediting. *(BC FCOP §3.5)*
- Start date cannot precede the date proponents obtained rights to submit the plan and claim offsets; Director rejects plans older than one year from protocol notice (or >5 years after activity start). *(BC FCOP §3.4)*
- Contingency Account functions as a buffer: contributions and remedial payments calculated via defined equations when reversals occur. *(BC FCOP §8.4.3; Equations 35 & 39)*
- Projects must occur in B.C. and document entitlements on land tenure (public, private, First Nations, treaty settlement, Aboriginal title). *(BC FCOP §3.1–§3.2)*
- Per-tonne grant or subsidy funding is incompatible; offsets must not be issued elsewhere. *(BC FCOP §3.1)*
- Agreements with First Nations or provincial commitments can influence start dates but must still meet entitlement and reporting rules. *(BC FCOP §3.4)*

## 4. Carbon Reduction Confidence
- Project plan must include an ISO 14064-2–aligned Monitoring & Maintenance Plan detailing data collection and risk management across crediting and monitoring periods. *(BC FCOP §3.1.1, §8.4.1, §10.0)*
- Project reports span 12 months to 5 years, reported on a calendar-year basis; Director may withhold issuance if reports are late. *(BC FCOP §3.7)*
- Monitoring period extends 100 years after the crediting period; monitoring reports due in four 25-year blocks within six months after each block. *(BC FCOP §3.5, §10.1)*
- Validation and verification bodies operate under EOPR accreditation; proponents must maintain data retention schedules to support audits. *(BC FCOP §1.0, §10.0)*
- Monitoring & Maintenance Plan must address risk categories (fire, pests, financial, etc.) and identify mitigation and reporting commitments backed by recent evidence. *(BC FCOP §8.4.1)*
- Reversal events occur when project emissions exceed baseline; proponents must quantify impacts and report impairment. *(BC FCOP §8.4.2; Equation 33)*
- Default natural-disturbance risk contributions to the contingency account are 18% (Coast), 27% (Northern Interior), and 37% (Southern Interior) before project-specific deductions; financial/management risk factors are added separately. *(BC FCOP Table 23; Table 25; Equations 39–41)*
- Materiality threshold set at ±5% of annual emissions/removals; applies to errors, omissions, and misrepresentation. *(BC FCOP §3.6)*
- Project plans must justify calculation methodologies for each sink/source/reservoir and ensure data quality through inventories (e.g., VRI) and sampling protocols. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §10.0)*
- Addresses activity leakage and external market leakage; provides default regional leakage factors (e.g., Coast ~47%, Northern Interior ~72%, Southern Interior ~69%) with option for project-specific analysis via Appendix C. *(BC FCOP §8.3; Tables 10–18)*
- Baseline assessments for avoided conversion must consider regional development trends and evidentiary requirements (permits, offers, economic analysis). *(BC FCOP §5.2.1)*
- Guidance encourages adjusting leakage estimates when species mix deviates from provincial averages. *(BC FCOP §8.3.2.3)*

## 5. Non-Carbon Metrics
- Required First Nations engagement steps (notice, meetings, incorporation of input, ongoing dialogue) serve as the primary social safeguard mechanism. *(BC FCOP §3.1.6)*
- Projects on First Nations or Treaty Settlement land need formal evidence of support (e.g., Band Council Resolution, Certificates of Possession). *(BC FCOP §3.2.3)*
- Protocol references compliance with other environmental/social statutes but does not mandate broader co-benefit certification frameworks. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*

## 6. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- 2024 revision introduced contingency account and risk-of-reversal framework, updated leakage defaults, required Monitoring & Maintenance Plans, and formalized First Nations engagement. *(BC FCOP Summary of Revisions)*
- Workshop prompts: How does the 25-year crediting/100-year monitoring structure influence perceptions of permanence? Is the 5% materiality threshold sufficient for high-variance forest data? Do engagement requirements meet expectations for robust social safeguards?
