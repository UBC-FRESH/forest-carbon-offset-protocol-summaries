# Workshop Context

This handout supports the UBC Sustainability Hub event
[Negotiation Innovation: Advancing Climate Action through Research and Learning](https://sustain.ubc.ca/events/negotiation-innovation-advancing-climate-action-through-research-and-learning).
It introduces four prominent forest carbon offset standards to spark critical, non-partisan
discussion among participants who may be new to the topic.

## How to Engage with the Summaries

- Treat every section as a starting point for questions rather than definitive conclusions.
- Compare how each standard addresses the four design elements (measurement protocols,
  certificates, carbon reduction confidence, non-carbon metrics) and identify vulnerabilities.
- Cross-reference the companion vulnerabilities briefing for prompts on design trade-offs.

_Status_: DRAFT for workshop circulation. Updates will follow as peer review feedback is
incorporated.
