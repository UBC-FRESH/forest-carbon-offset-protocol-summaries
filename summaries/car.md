# Climate Action Reserve – U.S. Forest Project Protocol Summary

*Reference shorthand: “FPP §X” denotes clauses in the U.S. Forest Protocol v5.1 (2023‑07‑20); “Appendix” references the same document; companion documents include Quantification Guidance (2017‑06‑28), Long-Term Management (2019‑06), and aggregation/summary notes.*

## 1. Snapshot
- U.S.-focused protocol covering Improved Forest Management (IFM), Reforestation, and Avoided Conversion; projects generate Climate Reserve Tonnes (CRTs) after third-party verification and Reserve review.
- Credit permanence enforced via 100-year monitoring and verification obligations post-final issuance; Buffer Pool insures against unavoidable reversals.
- Protocol underpins California’s compliance offset program and voluntary market CRTs; eligible projects may transition from Climate Forward or other programs following Reserve Program Manual procedures.

## 2. Governance & Eligibility
- **Project Operator & Ownership:** Project Operator must document carbon rights, ownership interests, and professional forester oversight (FPP §2.2; §8.1).
- **Eligible Lands:** IFM/Reforestation allowed on private, tribal, and subnational public lands; Avoided Conversion restricted to private lands unless transferred to public ownership with 100-year conservation easement (FPP §2.1; §3.2.3).
- **Project Area Definition:** IFM projects must include all forested acres controlled by the owner within the smallest applicable HUC12/14 watershed or full ownership; exceptions require Reserve approval (FPP §4.2).
- **Start Date & Listing:** Linked to discrete action (e.g., easement recordation, property transfer, project submittal) and projects must be listed within 12 months of start date (FPP §3.2).
- **Additionality Tests:** Legal Requirement Test, Performance Standard (standardized baselines), and long-term commitment (100-year) ensure surplus reductions (FPP §3.3).
- **Natural Forest Management:** Projects must meet native species, age distribution, structural element, and harvest retention criteria; progress checked at initial and subsequent verifications (FPP §3.9.1–§3.9.3; Table 3.3).

## 3. Baseline & Quantification
- **Baseline Stocks:** Derived from Assessment Area Data Files (peer group carbon averages) adjusted for legal constraints; must reflect business-as-usual management over 100 years (FPP §6.3; Appendix C).
- **Annual Net Reductions:** Equation 6.1 aggregates changes in onsite carbon (DeltaAConsite – DeltaBConsite), soil carbon (if applicable), harvested wood products (80 % factor for market response), secondary effects (leakage), and carry-over (FPP §6.1).
- **Leakage:** Activity-shifting leakage percentage determined via decision tree (Figure 6.1); applied annually to net onsite change for cropland/grazing displacement. Market leakage factor (0.2) embedded in harvested wood product term for IFM (FPP §6.2.6; Equation 6.3).
- **Confidence Deduction:** Statistical uncertainty deduction applied to inventory estimates per Appendix B; baseline re-assessed only if methodology changes approved by Reserve.

## 4. Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)
- **Reporting Periods:** Initial period up to 12 months; subsequent annual periods must be contiguous. Monitoring reports due within 12 months of each period end even if verification deferred (FPP §8.2–§8.3).
- **Verification Schedule:** Initial verification within 12 months of first reporting period; site visits required at least every six reporting periods (approx. six years) with desk reviews allowed between required visits under specified conditions (<4,000 CRTs/year issuance). Monitoring and verification continue 100 years post-final issuance (FPP §8.3.2; Table 8.1).
- **Documentation:** Project Design Document, calculation worksheets, attestations, verification statements, and Professional Forester oversight required; KML/GIS files must match project area maps (FPP §8.1; §4.2).

## 5. Credit Issuance & Registries
- **CRTs:** Issued after Reserve review of third-party verification report and compliance attestations; project enters Project Implementation Agreement (PIA) committing to long-term obligations (FPP §8.1).
- **Buffer Pool:** Project-specific reversal risk rating (Appendix A) determines percentage of CRTs contributed each issuance. Qualified conservation easements/deed restrictions can reduce risk rating; contributions adjusted if risk changes (FPP §7.2).
- **Reversals:** If annual net reductions (QRy) negative post-issuance, Reserve deems reversal. Unavoidable reversals (e.g., wildfire) compensated by Buffer Pool retirements; avoidable reversals require project to surrender CRTs within four months of verified estimate (FPP §7.3).
- **Termination:** Failure to report/verify as required or project area withdrawal triggers automatic termination and avoidable reversal treatment (FPP §3.5; §4.3).

## 6. Eligible Activities & Credit Use
- **Project Types:** IFM (sustainable harvest, stocking, structural upgrades), Reforestation (tree planting/regeneration on non-forest lands), Avoided Conversion (prevent conversion to non-forest use with 100-year easement). Aggregated projects follow additional guidance (Aggregation Guidelines 2017).
- **Stacking:** Allowed with prior Reserve approval to prevent double counting; project documentation must ensure baseline/additionality maintained (FPP §2.1).
- **Program Linkages:** Projects may transition to/from CARB Compliance Offset Program or Climate Forward; must follow Reserve Program Manual and meet respective buffer/verification rules (FPP §3.2; Long-Term Management note).

## 7. Safeguards & Co-benefits
- **Natural Forest Management:** Ensures native species composition, structural diversity, dead wood retention, watershed-scale age class balance, riparian protection, and soil disturbance limits (FPP §3.9; Table 3.2–3.3).
- **Harvest Controls:** Even-aged block size limits tied to residual basal area; re-entry restrictions until regeneration established (FPP §3.9.2).
- **Public Land Projects:** Require agency approval and public vetting consistent with management responsibilities; conservation easements mandate 100-year forest cover (FPP §2.1; §3.2).
- **Social Safeguards:** No explicit SDG framework; safeguards embedded in easement commitments, public approvals, and long-term monitoring requirements.

## 8. Permanence & Reversal Management
- **100-Year Obligation:** Project operators must maintain credited carbon stocks and conduct monitoring/verification for 100 years after final CRT issuance (FPP §7.1; §8.2).
- **Buffer Pool Contributions:** Risk-based (typically ~15–20 % per Reserve guidance); contributions withheld each issuance and may be adjusted if risk profile changes. Alternative insurance instruments may be allowed in future (FPP §7.2.2–7.2.3).
- **Natural Disturbance Response:** Projects must report unavoidable reversals within six months, submit verified inventory within two years (or when mortality stabilizes), and allow Reserve to retire Buffer Pool CRTs (FPP §7.3.1).
- **Avoidable Reversals:** Report within 30 days, verify within one year, and surrender CRTs; includes planned harvest exceeding baseline or misestimation (FPP §7.3.2).

## 9. Materiality & Data Quality
- **Inventory Standards:** Professional/Certified Forester oversight required; inventory methods documented in PDD and updates per Appendix B (FPP §8.1).
- **GIS & Parcel Reconciliation:** Acreage discrepancies resolved using lesser of GIS or assessor data or by working with assessor; KML shapefiles mandatory (FPP §4.2).
- **Verification Manual:** Reserve Verification Program Manual outlines sampling, error thresholds, corrective action, and dispute processes complementing protocol requirements (FPP §10).

## 10. Leakage Assessment & Mitigation
- **Activity-Shifting Leakage:** Decision tree assigns percentage (based on timber market, grazing/cropland displacement risk); applied annually to net onsite carbon changes (FPP Figure 6.1; Equation 6.3).
- **Market Leakage:** 0.2 factor embedded in harvested wood product term to account for market response where project harvest differs from baseline (FPP §6.2.6).
- **Quantification Guidance:** Companion document provides step-by-step inventory, growth model, and leakage calculations to ensure consistent application.

## 11. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- Version 5.1 clarifies natural forest management timelines, verification schedules, and easement provisions; maintains risk-based buffer approach aligned with CARB program.
- Discussion prompts: Compare CAR’s standardized baseline and Buffer Pool with VCS and Gold Standard approaches; debate practicality of 100-year monitoring requirement when designing “good” vs “bad” protocols; evaluate leakage treatment (decision tree + 0.2 market factor) relative to BC FCOP’s regional defaults and VCS optional deductions.
