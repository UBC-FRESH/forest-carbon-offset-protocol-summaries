# Climate Action Reserve – U.S. Forest Project Protocol Summary

*Reference shorthand: “FPP §X” denotes clauses in the U.S. Forest Protocol v5.1 (2023‑07‑20); “Appendix” references the same document; companion documents include Quantification Guidance (2017‑06‑28), Long-Term Management (2019‑06), and aggregation/summary notes.*

## 1. Snapshot
- U.S.-focused protocol covering Improved Forest Management (IFM), Reforestation, and Avoided Conversion; projects generate Climate Reserve Tonnes (CRTs) after third-party verification and Reserve review.
- Credit permanence enforced via 100-year monitoring and verification obligations post-final issuance; Buffer Pool insures against unavoidable reversals.
- Protocol underpins California’s compliance offset program and voluntary market CRTs; eligible projects may transition from Climate Forward or other programs following Reserve Program Manual procedures.

## 2. Carbon Accounting Protocols
- Climate Action Reserve administers the U.S. Forest Protocol; Project Implementation Agreement binds operators; Professional Forester oversight required. *(FPP §2.1; §8.1)*
- Eligible lands: IFM/Reforestation (private, tribal, and subnational public), Avoided Conversion (private with 100-year easement). Projects must include all forested acres owned within HUC12/14 unless approved otherwise. *(FPP §2.1; §4.2)*
- Project start date linked to discrete action (easement recordation, property transfer, project submittal) and listing must occur within 12 months. *(FPP §3.2)*
- Baseline uses standardized assessment area data with adjustments for legal constraints; project-specific justifications required for any deviations. *(FPP §6.3; Appendix C)*
- Additionality assured via Legal Requirement Test, performance standard, and 100-year commitment; natural forest management criteria govern native species, structure, and harvest practices. *(FPP §3.3; §3.9)*

## 3. Certificates
- CRTs issued after Reserve review of third-party verification and compliance attestations; Project Implementation Agreement sets obligations. *(FPP §8.1; §9)*
- Buffer Pool contributions determined by project-specific risk rating (Appendix A); qualified conservation easements or deed restrictions can reduce contributions. *(FPP §7.2)*
- Projects cannot receive credit simultaneously under other programs; gap validation and start-date rules manage transitions. *(Program Manual §3.23 analog)*
- Aggregated projects follow additional guidance; long-term management note outlines obligations beyond crediting. *(Aggregation Guidelines; Long-Term Management note)*

## 4. Carbon Reduction Confidence
- Annual monitoring with professional forester oversight; monitoring reports due within 12 months of each reporting period, even if verification deferred. *(FPP §8.2–§8.3)*
- Verification schedule requires initial verification within 12 months and site visits at least every six reporting periods (≈6 years); failure triggers suspension/termination. *(FPP §8.3.2; Table 8.1)*
- Baseline/on-site carbon updates use approved inventory methodologies, wood product accounting, and confidence deductions; negative annual totals trigger reversal procedures. *(FPP §6.1; §7.1)*
- Buffer pool and reversal provisions distinguish avoidable vs unavoidable events, detailing notification, quantification, and compensation timelines. *(FPP §7.2–§7.3)*
- Materiality managed via inventory confidence deductions, GIS acreage reconciliation, and professional standards. *(FPP §4.2; Appendix B)*
- Leakage addressed via decision tree assigning percentage deductions and 0.2 market factor for wood products; activity-shifting leakage assessed annually. *(FPP §6.2.6; Figure 6.1; Equation 6.3)*

## 5. Non-Carbon Metrics
- Natural Forest Management ensures native species composition, structural diversity, deadwood retention, and watershed-scale age balance. *(FPP §3.9.2; Table 3.3)*
- Sustainable harvesting guidelines limit block size relative to retention; conservation easements/public approvals required for public land projects. *(FPP §3.9.1; §2.1)*
- Social safeguards rely on easement commitments, public agency approval processes, and long-term monitoring obligations.

## 6. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- Version 5.1 clarifies natural forest management timelines, verification schedules, and easement provisions while maintaining risk-based buffer approach aligned with CARB program.
- Discussion prompts: How do standardized baselines interact with diverse landowner histories? Does buffer pooling sufficiently account for climate-driven disturbance trends? What trade-offs arise from mandatory HUC-based project area inclusion?

- Version 5.1 clarifies natural forest management timelines, verification schedules, and easement provisions; maintains risk-based buffer approach aligned with CARB program.
- Discussion prompts: Compare CAR’s standardized baseline and Buffer Pool with VCS and Gold Standard approaches; debate practicality of 100-year monitoring requirement when designing “good” vs “bad” protocols; evaluate leakage treatment (decision tree + 0.2 market factor) relative to BC FCOP’s regional defaults and VCS optional deductions.
