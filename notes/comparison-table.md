# Cross-Standard Comparison (Draft)

| Design Element | B.C. FCOP (2024) | Verra VCS (v4.7) | Gold Standard (v2.1 suite) | Climate Action Reserve (FPP v5.1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Carbon Accounting Protocols** | Provincial protocol under GGIRCA; Director accepts plans, issues units, and mandates First Nations engagement; baseline options include performance standard and project-specific pathways with 20-year records. | Verra manages global standard, methodology approval, and registry; baselines/additionality governed by methodology requirements with positive lists and regulatory surplus test; AFOLU crediting up to 100 years. | Principles & Requirements define governance, eligibility, and SDG commitments; LUF Activity Requirements and methodologies set baseline and additionality, including suppressed demand allowances. | Reserve administers U.S. Forest Protocol; standardized baselines by assessment area with legal requirement test; inclusion of all forested acres owned within HUC12/14; natural forest management criteria apply. |
| **Certificates** | 25-year crediting (extendable), 100-year monitoring; contingency account contributions; projects must document tenure rights; offsets cannot be double counted. | VCUs issued post-verification via Verra Registry; pooled buffer contributions; exclusions for certain renewables; projects can carry labels; terms prohibit double selling. | GSVERs issued after verification; PERs (ex-ante) convert later with 20% compliance buffer; Impact Registry handles labels and Article 6 authorisations; positive list governs eligible activities. | CRTs issued after Reserve review; buffer pool contributions risk-based; gap validation handles transitions; aggregation/long-term management guidelines support issuance. |
| **Carbon Reduction Confidence** | ISO 14064-2 monitoring plan, reports every 1–5 years, 100-year monitoring tail; reversal management via contingency account; 5% materiality; regional leakage factors with adjustments. | MRV requires QA/QC, calibrated equipment, site visits; AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool sets buffer percentage; 5%/1% materiality; leakage deductions (0–70%) plus activity-shifting options. | Monitoring plans specify indicators/QA; A/R methodology handles modelling/leakage; 20% buffer and carbon performance checks manage reversals; PER issuance and SDG indicators require careful validation. | Annual monitoring with professional forester oversight; verification schedule (site visits ≤6 years); buffer pool distinguishes avoidable/unavoidable reversals; confidence deductions and leakage decision tree manage uncertainty. |
| **Non-Carbon Metrics** | Mandatory First Nations engagement; projects on Indigenous lands require formal agreements; limited broader co-benefit frameworks. | Projects must contribute to ≥3 SDGs; stakeholder engagement, FPIC, grievance mechanisms, and extensive safeguards covering community, labour, biodiversity. | Comprehensive safeguards (human rights, gender, labour, biodiversity); gender equality requirements; two-stage consultation plus continuous grievance mechanism; potential price premiums for co-benefits. | Natural forest management maintains native species, structural diversity, deadwood; public land projects require agency approval; safeguards embedded in easement commitments. |
| **Notable Updates / Discussion Prompts** | 2024 revision added contingency account, risk-of-reversal tool, updated leakage defaults, and formalized First Nations engagement; consider permanence/materiality implications. | v4.7 expanded safeguards and SDG requirements; updated AFOLU risk/leakage oversight; prompts on permanence, SDG burden, leakage comparisons. | 2024/25 updates reinforce SDG alignment, financial additionality, 20% buffer, Article 6 reporting; discuss PER + buffer design, suppressed-demand baselines, multi-program governance. | v5.1 clarified natural forest management timelines, verification schedules, easement provisions; evaluate standardized baseline impacts, buffer adequacy under climate change, HUC inclusion trade-offs. |

## Discussion Themes (initial)
- Permanence strategies: compare contingency account (BC), pooled buffers (VCS, CAR), compliance buffer + PERs (Gold Standard).
- Stakeholder and social safeguards: First Nations focus vs global SDG requirements vs natural forest management criteria.
- Treatment of leakage: regional defaults vs decision trees vs optional deductions.
- Credit issuance pacing: PERs and CRTs with long-term monitoring vs VCUs; workshop could explore “good” vs “bad” design choices using buffer/leakage levers.
