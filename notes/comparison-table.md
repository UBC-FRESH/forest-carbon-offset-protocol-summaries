# Cross-Standard Comparison (Draft)

| KPI | B.C. FCOP (2024) | Verra VCS (v4.7) | Gold Standard (v2.1 suite) | Climate Action Reserve (FPP v5.1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Governance & Protocol Setting** | Provincial protocol under GGIRCA; Director accepts plans and issues offset units; mandatory First Nations engagement; integrates with EOPR requirements. | Managed by Verra non-profit; Program Guide defines roles for project proponents, methodology developers, VVBs, and Verra Registry; methodology development/approval process. | Gold Standard Foundation oversees certification; Principles & Requirements set global rules; Impact Registry manages issuance and Article 6 authorisations. | Climate Action Reserve administers U.S. Forest Protocol; Project Implementation Agreement binds operators; Professional Forester oversight required. |
| **Baseline & Additionality Rules** | Performance-standard vs project-specific baseline; 20-year historic data; regulatory & financial additionality assertions, revenue-dependency requirement. | Methodology-driven baseline; regulatory surplus mandatory; additionality via methodology tests or positive lists; activity-method modules allowed. | Baseline vs project scenario defined in Principles; must demonstrate SDG impacts (>=SDG13 + two) and financial additionality using UNFCCC/GS tools. | Standardized baselines by assessment area; legal requirement test; performance standard across 100-year horizon; long-term commitment assures additionality. |
| **Monitoring, Reporting, Verification** | ISO 14064-2 monitoring & maintenance plan; reports every 1–5 years; 100-year monitoring period; monitoring plan must address risk categories. | Monitoring plan with QA/QC; reasonable assurance verification with 5% materiality (1% large); site visits at validation, first verification, baseline reassessment. | Monitoring plan must specify parameters, frequency, ethics; A/R methodology requires >=90% remote sensing accuracy; verification per Product Requirements. | Annual monitoring reports; verification within 12 months of reporting period, site visits at least every 6 reporting periods; 100-year verification obligation post-issuance. |
| **Credit Issuance & Registries** | 25-year crediting (extendable), 100-year monitoring; contingency account remits based on risk tool; Director may withhold issuance. | VCUs issued post-verification via Verra Registry; buffer credits withheld based on AFOLU risk rating; registry prevents double selling. | GSVERs issued after performance certification; PERs (ex-ante) convert to GSVERs; 20% compliance buffer; Impact Registry tracks claims and Article 6 authorisations. | CRTs issued after Reserve review of independent verification; contributions to Buffer Pool based on reversal risk rating; 100-year Project Implementation Agreement. |
| **Eligible Activities & Credit Use** | British Columbia forest projects: AFF/REF, CONS/IFM, Avoided Conversion; BC jurisdiction only. | Global scope; AFOLU categories (ARR, IFM, REDD, etc.); exclusions for certain grid-connected renewables in non-LDCs. | LUF Positive List (afforestation, agroforestry, etc.); smallholder definitions; stacking allowed with compatibility checks. | U.S.-only: Improved Forest Management, Reforestation, Avoided Conversion; must include all forested acres under control within HUC12/14 unless approved. |
| **Safeguards & Co-benefits** | Mandatory First Nations engagement (notice, meetings, ongoing dialogue); references provincial statutes; limited broader social safeguards. | SDG contribution requirement (>=3 SDGs); extensive stakeholder engagement & grievance procedures; safeguarding principles covering social/environmental risks. | Comprehensive safeguarding (human rights, gender equality, labour, biodiversity); gender requirements; two-stage stakeholder consultation + continuous grievance channel. | Natural Forest Management standards (native species, structural diversity, harvest retention); conservation easement/public approval for public lands; long-term habitat sustainability. |
| **Permanence & Reversal Management** | Risk-of-Reversal tool (regional defaults 18/27/37% natural risk); contingency account contributions; monitoring plan must address risk categories; 100-year monitoring post-crediting. | AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool sets overall risk rating (min 12, max 60); buffer converts risk % to withheld VCUs; pooled buffer retires credits for reversals. | 20% Compliance Buffer for sequestration components; carbon performance checks vs issued credits; PERs convert after verification; buffer for sequestration only. | Buffer Pool contributions tied to project-specific risk rating; unavoidable reversals compensated from Buffer Pool, avoidable reversals require CRT surrender; monitoring/verification for 100 years. |
| **Materiality & Data Quality** | 5% materiality threshold; monitoring & maintenance plan must cite evidence <=10 years old; ISO 14064 alignment. | 5%/1% aggregate materiality; mandatory QA/QC; methodology deviations allowed only where conservative. | Monitoring plan requires QA/QC, data ethics; remote sensing classification >=90% accuracy; Impact Registry enforcement. | Inventories overseen by Professional Forester; confidence deduction applied per Appendix B; GIS acreage reconciliation. |
| **Leakage** | Default regional leakage percentages with option for project-specific adjustment (Appendix C); activity leakage & market leakage addressed separately. | Activity leakage optional 15% deduction; market leakage adjustments (0%–70%) for IFM; international leakage not required. | A/R methodology deducts leakage (fuelwood, timber, agriculture, livestock) in year 1; optional activity-shifting factor; compliance buffer addresses residual risk. | Leakage decision tree sets activity-shifting percentage; 0.2 market factor embedded in harvested wood products; secondary effects quantified annually. |
| **Notable Updates / Discussion Prompts** | 2024 revision added contingency account, risk tool, mandatory First Nations engagement; compare regional risk defaults vs other buffers. | v4.7 expands safeguards and SDG requirements; evaluate positive-list additionality vs standardized baselines. | 2024 updates reinforce SDG alignment and compliance buffer; consider interaction of PERs and buffer contributions in good/bad scenarios. | v5.1 clarifies natural forest management timelines, verification schedules; contrast 100-year obligations and market leakage factor with other standards. |

## Discussion Themes (initial)
- Permanence strategies: compare contingency account (BC), pooled buffers (VCS, CAR), compliance buffer + PERs (Gold Standard).
- Stakeholder and social safeguards: First Nations focus vs global SDG requirements vs natural forest management criteria.
- Treatment of leakage: regional defaults vs decision trees vs optional deductions.
- Credit issuance pacing: PERs and CRTs with long-term monitoring vs VCUs; workshop could explore “good” vs “bad” design choices using buffer/leakage levers.
