# Protocol Summary & Comparison Table Templates

## Narrative Summary Template (per Standard)

1. **Snapshot**
   - Latest version/date, managing organization, applicable geographies.
   - Recognized project categories (e.g., afforestation, improved forest management).
   - Notable companion programs (e.g., Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards).

2. **Governance & Protocol Setting**
   - Decision-making structure, methodology approval workflow, funding model.
   - Revision cadence and stakeholder engagement channels.

3. **Baseline & Additionality Rules**
   - Baseline approach(es) used.
   - Additionality tests (financial/regulatory/barrier) and documentation expectations.
   - Data sources or modelling tools prescribed.

4. **Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)**
   - Monitoring frequency, responsible parties, accepted methods.
   - Validator qualifications, accreditation, and audit cycle.
   - Non-conformity handling or corrective action process.

5. **Credit Issuance & Registries**
   - Steps from verification to issuance, registry platform, serialization.
   - Buffer pool or other risk-sharing mechanisms and contribution rates.
   - Crediting period length and renewal provisions.

6. **Eligible Activities & Credit Use**
   - Project activity eligibility (forest types, land tenure).
   - Market scope (compliance vs voluntary) and buyer limitations.
   - Linkages to other policy instruments or trading schemes.

7. **Safeguards & Co-benefits**
   - Social/environmental safeguards, stakeholder consultation requirements.
   - Co-benefit certification options or mandatory sustainable development contributions.
   - Indigenous/community engagement obligations.

8. **Permanence & Reversal Management**
   - Permanence period expectations, monitoring tail length.
   - Risk assessment tools, contingency plans, reversal procedures.

9. **Materiality Thresholds & Data Quality**
   - Materiality triggers, uncertainty thresholds, recalculation rules.
   - Data quality or QA/QC requirements.

10. **Leakage Assessment & Mitigation**
    - Geographic scope, assessment methodologies, deduction application.
    - Leakage monitoring and reporting obligations.

11. **Recent Updates & Open Questions**
    - Key revisions impacting current practice.
    - Ambiguities or active debates to flag as discussion prompts.

### Formatting Notes
- Target length: ~1 page per protocol, using consistent headings for ease of comparison.
- Use neutral, descriptive language; frame uncertainties as “Considerations for discussion.”
- Include light quantitative details in-line (e.g., “Buffer contribution: 10–20% based on risk tier.”).
- Reference source documents in footnotes or parenthetical citations for future verification (e.g., “(VCS Standard v4.7, §3)”).

### Table Guidance
- Use concise bullet-style phrasing inside cells (maximum 2–3 sentences).
- Prioritize contrasts that feed workshop debate (e.g., differences in permanence handling).
- Ensure terminology matches the narrative summaries and participant worksheet wording.
- When including numeric ranges, add context (e.g., “Buffer: 10–20% depending on risk tier”).
