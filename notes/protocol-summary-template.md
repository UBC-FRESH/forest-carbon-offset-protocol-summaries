# Protocol Summary & Comparison Table Templates

## Narrative Summary Template (per Standard)

1. **Snapshot**
   - Latest version/date, managing organization, applicable geographies.
   - Recognized project categories (e.g., afforestation, improved forest management).
   - Notable companion programs (e.g., Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards).

2. **Carbon Accounting Protocols**
   - Who establishes and funds the protocol; methodology governance; revision cadence.
   - Baseline approach(es), additionality demonstrations, data sources, and modelling tools.

3. **Certificates**
   - Credit issuance workflow, registry platform, serialization, and buffer/risk-sharing mechanisms.
   - Eligible activities and emissions, market scope (compliance vs voluntary), buyer limitations, and linkage to other instruments.

4. **Carbon Reduction Confidence**
   - Monitoring and verification responsibilities, frequency, accreditation, and corrective action processes.
   - Permanence expectations, reversal management, buffer tools; materiality thresholds and uncertainty treatments; leakage scope, metrics, and deductions.

5. **Non-Carbon Metrics**
   - Safeguards, stakeholder engagement, co-benefit requirements, and Indigenous/community obligations.
   - Price premiums or third-party roles supporting safeguards, if applicable.

6. **Recent Updates & Open Questions**
    - Key revisions impacting current practice.
    - Ambiguities or active debates to flag as discussion prompts.

### Formatting Notes
- Target length: ~1 page per protocol, using consistent headings for ease of comparison.
- Use neutral, descriptive language; frame uncertainties as “Considerations for discussion.”
- Include light quantitative details in-line (e.g., “Buffer contribution: 10–20% based on risk tier.”).
- Reference source documents in footnotes or parenthetical citations for future verification (e.g., “(VCS Standard v4.7, §3)”).

## Comparison Table Schema

| Design Element | B.C. FCOP | Verra (VCS) | Gold Standard | Climate Action Reserve |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Carbon Accounting Protocols | Governance, baseline, and additionality highlights. | ... | ... | ... |
| Certificates | Issuance process, registry roles, eligible uses. | | | |
| Carbon Reduction Confidence | MRV, permanence, materiality, leakage mechanisms. | | | |
| Non-Carbon Metrics | Safeguards, co-benefits, stakeholder engagement. | | | |
| Notable Updates / Discussion Prompts | Recent changes, open questions to explore. | | | |

### Table Guidance
- Use concise bullet-style phrasing inside cells (maximum 2–3 sentences).
- Prioritize contrasts that feed workshop debate (e.g., differences in permanence handling).
- Ensure terminology matches the narrative summaries and participant worksheet wording.
- When including numeric ranges, add context (e.g., “Buffer: 10–20% depending on risk tier”).
