## Follow-Up Tasks

- [x] BC FCOP vulnerabilities: locate evidence on enforcement resourcing transparency, public availability of First Nations engagement records, and financial additionality disclosures—or revise language accordingly.
- [x] Verra VCS vulnerabilities: document sources on methodology “standard shopping,” VVB conflict-of-interest incentives, and grace-period utilisation to support claims or adjust commentary.
- [x] Gold Standard vulnerabilities: compile references regarding consultant-driven optimisation, suppressed-demand baseline inflation, and safeguard oversight effectiveness; revise statements if evidence is limited.
- [x] CAR vulnerabilities: gather documentation on Reserve board incentives, appraisal practices for avoided conversion, buffer adequacy under changing disturbance regimes, HUC inclusion gaming, and verification deadline handling.
- [x] Cross-cutting issues: source empirical studies on registry transparency, buffer/contingency performance under climate risk, and methodology grace-period exploitation to substantiate overarching observations.
