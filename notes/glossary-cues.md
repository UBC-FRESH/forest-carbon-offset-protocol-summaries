# Glossary & Cross-Standard Notes

## Shared Terminology (draft)
- **AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry & Other Land Use):** Sector category used by VCS and Gold Standard for land-based projects. Use consistently when comparing permanence/leakage approaches.
- **VCU / GSVER / Offset Unit:** Use protocol-specific names when describing credit instruments; define once in handouts (e.g., “Gold Standard Verified Emission Reduction (GSVER)”). Clarify that PERs (Planned Emission Reductions) are ex-ante issuances unique to Gold Standard.
- **Compliance Buffer / Pooled Buffer:** Note 20 % Gold Standard Compliance Buffer vs VCS risk-rated buffer percentage vs BC FCOP Contingency Account. Provide short comparative explanation in table legend.
- **Buffer Pool (CAR):** Distinguish CAR’s risk-rated Buffer Pool contributions (CRTs withheld per reversal risk) from VCS buffer percentages and Gold Standard compliance buffer; mention reversible CRT term “Climate Reserve Tonne (CRT).”
- **Planned Emission Reduction (PER):** Gold Standard ex-ante instrument that converts to GSVER after verification; highlight when discussing permanence incentives.
- **Positive List / Activity Method:** Link Gold Standard Positive List and VCS activity-method modules; use phrase “pre-approved activity list” when addressing non-expert audiences.
- **Stakeholder Consultation:** Emphasise two-round Gold Standard requirement; compare with VCS public comment + ongoing engagement and BC FCOP First Nations engagement requirements.
- **Impact Registry / Verra Registry / Provincial Registry:** Clarify each registry’s role to avoid confusion in the comparison table.

## Co-Certification & SDG Labels
- VCS projects may rely on CCB or SD VISta verification to satisfy SDG contribution requirements (VCS Standard §3.17.2). Suggest noting this in comparison table under “Safeguards & Co-benefits” as a footnote rather than a primary column item.
- Gold Standard inherently requires SDG impact demonstration; no separate co-certification needed but SDG Impact Tool may be referenced as optional guidance. Leave SDG Impact Tool mention for facilitation notes rather than the handout table.
