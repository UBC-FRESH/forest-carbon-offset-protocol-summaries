# BC FCOP Key Points (for Narrative Summary)

## Snapshot
- **Protocol:** British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Offset Protocol – Forest Carbon, Version 2 (April 18 2024), issued by the Director under Section 10 of the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act (GGIRCA). *(Cover; Section 1.0)*
- **Project Types:** Afforestation/Reforestation (AFF/REF), Conservation & Improved Forest Management (CONS/IFM), and Avoided Conversion (AC). *(Section 3.3)*
- **Geography:** Applicable to forest carbon projects in British Columbia; integrates with the Emission Offset Project Regulation (EOPR) and other provincial legislation. *(Sections 1.0, 3.1)*

## Governance & Protocol Setting
- Established under GGIRCA with legal obligations for project proponents, validation bodies, and verification bodies; protocol requirements supplement EOPR. *(Section 1.0)*
- Director under GGIRCA oversees project plan acceptance, credit issuance, and enforcement (e.g., can withhold offsets if reports outstanding). *(Sections 3.4, 3.7, 8.4.3)*
- Project proponents must comply with other provincial laws and maintain records per EOPR; Interpretation Act applies. *(Section 1.0)*
- Engagement with Applicable First Nations is mandatory, including notice, meetings, and ongoing reporting. *(Section 3.1.6)*

## Baseline & Additionality Rules
- **Baseline selection:** AFF/REF on public land must use performance standard approach (regulatory requirements or continuation of historic activities, whichever is more conservative); other projects use project-specific approach with candidate screening, obstacle assessment, and documentation. *(Sections 5.1–5.2)*
- Requires 20-year historic management record for continuation-of-historic-practices baselines and defined candidate lists per project type (Table 2). *(Section 5.2.1)*
- **Additionality:** Project plan must assert revenue from offset sales is required, demonstrate financial additionality (update in each report), and confirm activities not mandated by regulation unless they exceed requirements. *(Sections 3.1, 6.1–6.2)*
- Prevents double counting: project reduction cannot be credited elsewhere. *(Section 6.2)*

## Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)
- Project plans must include ISO 14064‑2:2019–aligned Monitoring & Maintenance Plan covering the crediting and monitoring periods. *(Sections 3.1.1, 8.4.1, 10.0)*
- Project reports: minimum 12 months, maximum 5 years, calendar-year reporting; validation and verification per EOPR; Director may withhold issuance until reports submitted. *(Section 3.7)*
- Monitoring period extends 100 years post-crediting; monitoring reports due at defined intervals (Years 1–25, 26–50, 51–75, 76–100) within 6 months of period end. *(Section 10.1)*
- Validation/verification bodies follow GGIRCA/EOPR accreditation; project proponents must maintain data retention schedule. *(Sections 1.0, 10.0)*

## Credit Issuance & Registries
- Credit period set at 25 years from project start (extendable via new validation); monitoring continues for 100 years. *(Section 3.5)*
- Director can reject plans with start dates older than one year post-protocol notice (or five years post start) and may withhold issuance for non-compliance. *(Section 3.4, 3.7)*
- Contingency Account contributions and reversal management govern buffer-style withholding; remittances calculated via defined equations. *(Section 8.4.3; Equations 35, 39)*

## Eligible Activities & Credit Use
- Projects must occur in BC and meet project-type eligibility criteria; specific requirements per land tenure (public, private, First Nations). *(Sections 3.1–3.3)*
- Start date tied to entitlement to submit plan and claim offsets; special provisions for agreements with First Nations or provincial measures. *(Section 3.4)*
- Projects must assert offsets not claimed in other systems; funding on per-tonne basis disallowed. *(Section 3.1)*

## Safeguards & Co-benefits
- Mandatory First Nations engagement (notice, meeting, information sharing, ongoing dialogue); project plans must document incorporation of feedback. *(Section 3.1.6)*
- For projects on First Nations or Treaty Settlement Land, additional documentation (e.g., Band Council Resolution, certificates of possession) required. *(Section 3.2.3)*
- Protocol references adherence to other provincial statutes (e.g., Forest Act, Professional Governance Act) but does not prescribe broader social safeguard frameworks beyond engagement. *(Section 1.0; Section 3.1)*

## Permanence & Reversal Management
- Monitoring & Maintenance Plan must address specific risk categories (fire, pests, financial, etc.) using evidence within previous 10 years. *(Section 8.4.1)*
- Reversal events defined where project emissions exceed baseline; project proponents must report and may owe remittances to Contingency Account. *(Sections 8.4.2–8.4.3; Equations 33–36)*
- Contingency Account contributions based on natural and non-natural disturbance risk with default risk tables and mitigation deductions. *(Section 8.4.3; Table 23–25)*

## Materiality Thresholds & Data Quality
- Materiality set at ±5% of project emissions/removals per calendar year; applies to errors, omissions, misrepresentation. *(Section 3.6)*
- Project plans must justify calculation methodologies for each sink/source/reservoir (SSR) and ensure data quality (e.g., VRI data, field sampling). *(Sections 3.1, 10.0)*

## Leakage Assessment & Mitigation
- Addresses activity and market leakage; default external market leakage factors provided for BC regions, with option for project-specific adjustments via Appendix C. *(Section 8.3)*
- Project-specific leakage requires parameters such as substitution and preservation factors; table of default values provided. *(Section 8.3; Tables 10–18)*
- Baseline candidate assessment must consider regional development scenarios to manage leakage risk in avoided conversion projects. *(Section 5.2.1)*

## Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- 2024 revision added contingency account requirements, risk-of-reversal tool, updated leakage defaults, monitoring & maintenance plan obligations, and mandatory First Nations engagement. *(Summary of Revisions, Page 2)*
- Consider workshop questions on balancing 25-year crediting vs 100-year monitoring obligations, adequacy of 5% materiality threshold, and sufficiency of First Nations engagement requirements as primary social safeguard.
