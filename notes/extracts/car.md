# Climate Action Reserve – Forest Project Protocol Key Points

## Snapshot
- **Protocol:** U.S. Forest Protocol Version 5.1 (July 20 2023) governs Improved Forest Management (IFM), Reforestation, and Avoided Conversion projects in the United States; companion documents include quantification guidance, aggregation guidelines, and long-term management notes.
- **Credit Instrument:** Climate Reserve Tonnes (CRTs) issued after third-party verification; projects must monitor and verify for 100 years post-final issuance.
- **Program Linkages:** Aligns with California Air Resources Board (CARB) Compliance Offset Program; eligible projects may transition from Climate Forward or other programs following Reserve Program Manual rules.

## Governance & Eligibility
- Project Operator may be the landowner or delegated entity; legal ownership and carbon rights must be documented (Protocol §2.2; §8.1).
- Eligible lands: U.S. private, municipal, tribal (IFM/Reforestation), private (Avoided Conversion) with conservation easement requirements; projects must include all forested acres a landowner controls within the smallest applicable hydrologic unit (HUC12/14) unless approved otherwise (§2.1; §4.2).
- Additionality tests include Legal Requirement Test (no mandated activities), Performance Standard (comparison to standardized baselines), and Search for Alternative Baselines over 100-year horizon (§3.3).
- Project start date tied to discrete action (e.g., easement recording, property transfer, project submittal) and listing within 12 months (§3.2).
- Natural Forest Management criteria require native species composition, age-class diversity, structural elements (dead wood), and sustainable harvest retention; assessed at initial and subsequent verifications with progress timelines (§3.9.2; Table 3.3).

## Baseline & Quantification
- Standardized baseline carbon stocks derived from Assessment Area Data Files (peer group averages) with adjustments for site conditions and legal constraints (§6.3; Appendix C).
- Annual net GHG reductions (Equation 6.1) aggregate onsite carbon changes, soil carbon (if applicable), wood products (80 % factor for market leakage), and secondary effects (activity shifting leakage) (§6.1–6.2).
- Leakage: default risk percentage determined via decision tree (Figure 6.1); applied annually to net onsite change for cropland/grazing displacement; market leakage factor (0.2) embedded in harvested wood product term for IFM (§6.2.6; Equation 6.3).
- Confidence deduction applied to inventory estimates based on statistical uncertainty (Appendix B).

## Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)
- Monitoring reports due within 12 months of each Reporting Period end; annual reporting mandatory even if verification is deferred (§8.2–§8.3).
- Verification: initial verification within 12 months of first reporting period; subsequent site visits every six reporting periods (approx. six years) unless low issuance (<4,000 CRTs/year) qualifies for desk-review schedule. Monitoring and verification continue 100 years post-final issuance (§8.3.2; Table 8.1).
- Documentation includes Project Design Document, annual calculation worksheets, attestation forms, verification statements, and Professional Forester oversight (§8.1).

## Permanence & Reversal Management
- Reversals defined as negative net reductions (QRy) after any issuance; projects must maintain onsite carbon for 100 years (§7.1).
- Buffer Pool: project-specific risk rating (Appendix A) determines % contribution each issuance; contributions may be adjusted if risk changes. Qualified conservation easements can lower risk (§7.2.2).
- Unavoidable reversals (natural disturbances) compensated via Buffer Pool retirements; avoidable reversals (negligence, harvest) require project to surrender CRTs within four months of verified estimate (§7.3).
- Projects may terminate automatically if required reporting/verification lapses; partial termination treated as avoidable reversal with PDD addendum (§3.5; §4.3).

## Safeguards & Co-benefits
- Natural Forest Management standards safeguard biodiversity, habitat, and structural complexity (§3.9.2; Table 3.3).
- Sustainable harvesting guidelines regulate even-aged block sizes, retention thresholds, and watershed-scale young forest limits (§3.9.1).
- Riparian protection, soil disturbance limits, and road management addressed in quantification and monitoring appendices.
- Social safeguards indirectly covered through conservation easement requirements and public approval processes for public land projects; no explicit SDG framework.

## Credit Issuance & Registries
- CRTs issued after Reserve review of third-party verification; Project Implementation Agreement (PIA) ensures compliance post-registration (§8.1).
- Buffer pool contributions withheld automatically; Reserve retires CRTs for unavoidable reversals and may distribute excess if risk declines (§7.2).
- Projects interacting with CARB Compliance Offset Program follow additional CARB guidance; Reserve documents long-term management expectations and DEB (Direct Environmental Benefits) considerations for California locations (Long-Term Management doc).

## Materiality & Data Quality
- Inventories must be overseen by Professional Forester/Certified Forester; inventory updates follow Appendix B protocols with required accuracy (confidence deduction) (§8.1; Appendix B).
- GIS-based acreage calculations and parcel reconciliations ensure accurate area reporting (§4.2).
- Verification manual supplements specify sampling, error thresholds, and dispute resolution (Verification Program Manual).

## Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- Version 5.1 adjustments (per summary of changes) streamline natural forest management timelines and clarify monitoring/verification schedules; maintain buffer contribution framework (~15–20 % typical risk range).
- Discussion ideas: Compare CAR’s standardized baseline and buffer pool (risk-based %) with VCS activity methods and BC contingency accounts; examine permanence obligations (100-year verification) relative to Gold Standard’s compliance buffer; explore leakage handling (decision tree + 0.2 market factor) when designing “good” vs “bad” protocols.
