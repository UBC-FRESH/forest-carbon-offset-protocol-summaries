# Gold Standard Key Points (for Narrative Summary)

## Snapshot
- **Core governance documents:** Principles & Requirements v2.1 (5 Dec 2024), Stakeholder Consultation & Engagement Requirements v2.1 (14 Jun 2022), Safeguarding Principles & Requirements v2.1 (29 Jun 2023), Gender Equality Requirements v2.0 (16 Dec 2020).
- **Land-use specifics:** Land Use & Forests (LUF) Activity Requirements v1.2.1 (Apr 2020), LUF Positive List (RC 2025), Smallholder definitions (RU 2021), and A/R GHG Emission Reduction & Sequestration Methodology v2.1 (May 2024).
- **Quantification & issuance:** GHG Emissions Reduction & Sequestration Product Requirements v3.0 (Nov 2024) define crediting cycles, Impact Registry procedures, compliance buffer, and Planned Emission Reductions (PERs).

## Governance & Protocol Setting
- Gold Standard Foundation administers certification; projects progress through Gold Standard Certified Project Design → Gold Standard Certified Project stages with optional product labels (Principles & Requirements §2.1–2.3).
- General eligibility requires defined project area/boundary, legal compliance, uncontested rights, and avoidance of double counting with other standards (Principles & Requirements §3.1.1).
- Impact Registry manages issuance, retirement, and host-country authorisations; terms of use prevent double selling and enable labelling for Article 6 claims (GHG Product Requirements §§10, 11, 14).
- LUF Activity Requirements specify additional project documentation (GIS layers, socio-economic profiles, risk assessments) and align with FSC dual certification options (§4.1.2, Tables 1–2).

## Baseline & Additionality Rules
- All projects must define conservative baseline and project scenarios considering applicable legislation; suppressed demand baselines allowed only for small-scale projects where permitted (Principles & Requirements §4.1.8–4.1.10).
- Projects must demonstrate positive SDG impacts beyond baseline (minimum SDG 13 plus two others) and include monitoring indicators in the design documentation (Principles & Requirements §4.1.12–4.1.16).
- Financial additionality required for issuance of Gold Standard products: apply UNFCCC or GS-approved additionality tools (CDM Tool 01, Tool 21, etc.) and evidence carbon finance necessity (Principles & Requirements §§4.1.46–4.1.48).
- LUF Activity Requirements reiterate additionality for A/R projects via Principle 5 and require regulatory surplus (LUF §5.1; A/R Methodology §3.2.2–3.2.3).

## Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)
- Project monitoring plan must detail parameters, frequency, collection methods, roles, QA/QC, and ethical considerations; plan validated and forms basis of periodic reports (Principles & Requirements §§4.1.40–4.1.45).
- A/R methodology defines modelling units, growth models, and conversion factors; leakage and baseline deductions applied at t=1, with ongoing inventory-based monitoring of CO₂ removals (A/R Methodology §§3.3–3.7).
- GHG Product Requirements outline crediting cycles (default max 10-year period in absence of activity-specific rules), retroactive issuance limits (2 years, 3 for A/R), and verification before Impact Registry issuance (§§10.1–10.4).
- Performance Certification compares monitored carbon stocks against issued PERs/GSVERs; shortfalls trigger remedial actions per Performance Shortfall Guidelines (GHG Product Requirements §11.4.1).

## Credit Issuance & Registries
- VCUs equivalent: Gold Standard Verified Emission Reductions (GSVERs) issued post-performance certification; Planned Emission Reductions (PERs) allowed for A/R (valid for up to 5 years) and agriculture (up to 3 years) with conversion to GSVERs after verification (§11.2.1–11.2.3).
- 20 % of issued PERs/GSVERs from sequestration components must be transferred to the Gold Standard Compliance Buffer; projects may substitute GSVERs from other projects to meet obligations (§11.1.1–11.1.2).
- Impact Registry tracks serials, authorisations, and labels (e.g., Article 6 use); dual certification/stacking permitted only with Gold Standard approval and no double counting (Principles & Requirements §2.3; GHG Product Requirements §§10–15).

## Eligible Activities & Credit Use
- Project types must match approved Activity Requirements or secure eligibility approval; Gold Standard excludes fossil fuel-based energy, geo-engineering, and other non-aligned technologies (Principles & Requirements §§4.1.3–4.1.7).
- LUF Positive List identifies pre-approved afforestation/reforestation practices; smallholder definitions (holdings up to 25 ha, income thresholds) set tailored requirements (RC 2025 Positive List; RU 2021 Smallholder Definition).
- Projects engaged in other standards must ensure aggregated crediting periods do not exceed Gold Standard limits; pre-CDM GSVERs allowed with surrender commitments (GHG Product Requirements §§10.1.2, 10.7.1).

## Safeguards & Co-benefits
- Safeguarding Principles cover human rights, gender equality, labour conditions, biodiversity, ecosystems, cultural heritage, and conflict sensitivity; risks must be assessed with mitigation measures and supporting evidence (Safeguarding Principles §§4–5, Annex).
- Gender Requirements mandate gender-sensitive impact assessments, equal participation, and reporting on gender indicators (Gender Equality Requirements §§1–3).
- Stakeholder consultation includes two formal rounds (Local Stakeholder Consultation I & II), documentation of comments, and implementation of a continuous input & grievance mechanism (Stakeholder Consultation Requirements §§3.1–3.8).
- Projects must ensure FPIC where rights may be affected, maintain stakeholder contact lists, and report on engagement/ grievance outcomes in each monitoring period (Stakeholder Consultation Requirements §§3.5–3.8; LUF Annex D).

## Permanence & Reversal Management
- Compliance Buffer (20 % for sequestration components) covers potential reversals; applies to PERs and GSVERs from carbon stock changes (GHG Product Requirements §11.1.1).
- Carbon Performance provisions require projects to track carbon stocks vs issued credits, notify Gold Standard within 30 days of incidents, and implement corrective measures per Performance Shortfall Guidelines (§11.4.1b–c).
- LUF Activity Requirements stipulate protected areas, riparian buffer zones (15 m), mosaic planting design, and land-use history documentation to reduce reversal risk (§§4.1, 5.2, 7.2; Annexes).

## Materiality Thresholds & Data Quality
- Monitoring plan mandates QA/QC procedures; A/R methodology requires 90 % classification accuracy for remote sensing eligibility assessments and documentation of default values/data sources (A/R Methodology Annex C §§1.1.4–1.1.8; §3.5.2).
- All impact indicators must include data collection methods, responsible parties, and ethical considerations (Principles & Requirements §4.1.40).
- Impact Registry Terms enforce accurate reporting; false statements or double claims can trigger suspension and removal (GHG Product Requirements §§13–14).

## Leakage Assessment & Mitigation
- A/R methodology calculates leakage via four activity categories (fuelwood, timber, agriculture, livestock) with deductions applied in crediting year 1, using activity-shift percentages and CO₂-stock estimates (A/R Methodology §§3.7.1–3.7.8).
- LUF Activity Requirements require socio-economic assessments and land-use plans to identify potential displacement; projects must design buffer zones and mosaics to minimise leakage (§§4.1.2, 7.2, 12).

## Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts
- Version 2.1 updates to Principles & Requirements and Safeguarding documents reinforce SDG alignment, financial additionality, gender equality, and human rights protections; GHG Product Requirements v3.0 (2024) codify 20 % buffer and Article 6 labelling workflows.
- Discussion ideas: Evaluate how Gold Standard’s dual requirement for SDG impacts and financial additionality shapes project design; compare the 20 % compliance buffer and Carbon Performance checks with VCS and CAR permanence approaches; explore stakeholder consultation depth vs other protocols when designing “good” vs “bad” offset systems.
