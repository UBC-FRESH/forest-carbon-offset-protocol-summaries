# Forest Carbon Offset Workshop – KPI Framework

## Tone & Quantitative Guidance
- Maintain an academic, neutral voice suitable for a multi-perspective audience; avoid value judgements or advocacy phrasing.
- Present quantitative details sparingly (e.g., crediting periods, buffer percentages, monitoring frequencies) to illustrate mechanisms without overwhelming non-experts.
- Avoid highlighting controversial case studies in the handouts; if context is needed, frame it as a general thematic observation rather than citing specific scandals.

## KPI Structure Aligned with Participant Worksheet

| Participant Worksheet Metric | Workshop KPI Label | Purpose & Content Scope | Optional Quantitative Touchpoints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Establishment of (Carbon/Measurement) Protocols | **Governance & Protocol Setting** | Who owns/updates the standard, approval pathways for methodologies, funding model for protocol development, role of public vs. private actors. | Governance tiers, revision cycles, approval timelines. |
| Baseline and Additionality Determination | **Baseline & Additionality Rules** | Baseline approaches (performance standard vs. project-specific), additionality tests (financial, regulatory, barriers), data requirements, modelling guidance. | Baseline period length, scenario modeling windows, benchmark datasets used. |
| Monitoring and Verification | **Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)** | Monitoring frequency, data types, third-party validator roles, accreditation requirements, audit cadence, corrective action processes. | Monitoring interval years, verification cycle length, validator accreditation bodies. |
| Issuance of Certificates | **Credit Issuance & Registries** | Steps from verification to issuance, registry requirements, buffer pool contributions, credit serialization, retirement mechanics. | Buffer % contributions, issuance fees, crediting period length. |
| Use of Offsets | **Eligible Activities & Credit Use** | Project activity types, market segments served (compliance vs voluntary), buyer eligibility limits, program linkages. | Activity category definitions, credit eligibility restrictions per sector/jurisdiction. |
| Incorporation of Non-Carbon Metrics | **Safeguards & Co-benefits** | Social and environmental safeguard requirements, co-benefit certification options, stakeholder engagement obligations, Indigenous/community provisions. | Required stakeholder engagement timelines, co-benefit scoring systems. |
| Permanence | **Permanence & Reversal Management** | Crediting period vs. permanence obligations, buffer accounts, reversal response plans, risk assessment tools. | Buffer contributions (%), monitoring tail length (e.g., 40/100 years), reversal guarantee mechanisms. |
| Materiality | **Materiality Thresholds & Data Quality** | Thresholds for reporting/verification, data quality expectations, uncertainty treatment, recalculation triggers. | Materiality % thresholds, uncertainty discount factors. |
| Leakage | **Leakage Assessment & Mitigation** | Geographic scope for leakage, qualitative/quantitative requirements, leakage belt management, deductions applied. | Default leakage deduction %, applicable radii/distances. |

### Additional Cross-Cutting Elements to Capture
- **Versioning & Recent Updates:** Note major revisions that influence current practice (e.g., BC FCOP 2024 changes).
- **Indigenous Rights & Community Engagement:** Explicitly call out requirements for Indigenous consultation where present (aligns with workshop emphasis on social dimensions).
- **Risk Management Instruments:** Tools or calculators (e.g., non-permanence risk tools) that may be useful touchpoints during the workshop exercises.
- **Interoperability with Other Standards:** Where protocols link to complementary schemes (e.g., VCS + CCB, CAR + California Cap-and-Trade), flag connections briefly.

## Next Actions
- Use this KPI map to populate the summary template for each protocol, ensuring consistent headings and comparable depth.
- When drafting the comparison table, order columns by this KPI sequence so participants can scan differences quickly.
