# Forest Carbon Offset Workshop – KPI Framework

## Tone & Quantitative Guidance
- Maintain an academic, neutral voice suitable for a multi-perspective audience; avoid value judgements or advocacy phrasing.
- Present quantitative details sparingly (e.g., crediting periods, buffer percentages, monitoring frequencies) to illustrate mechanisms without overwhelming non-experts.
- Avoid highlighting controversial case studies in the handouts; if context is needed, frame it as a general thematic observation rather than citing specific scandals.

## KPI Themes Aligned with Workshop Design Elements

| Design Element | Legacy KPIs | Purpose & Content Scope | Optional Quantitative Touchpoints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Carbon Accounting Protocols** | 1, 2 | Who establishes and funds protocols; methodology approval pathways; baseline and additionality logic including data sources, modelling approaches, spatial/temporal scales, and project development funding. | Governance tiers, revision cycles, baseline period length, modelling horizons, benchmark datasets. |
| **Certificates** | 4, 5 | How credits are issued, serialized, and retired; registry roles; buffer/fee structures; eligible project activities and emissions, and who can use offsets against which emissions. | Buffer contributions (%), issuance fees, crediting period length, eligible activity categories, buyer segmentation. |
| **Carbon Reduction Confidence** | 3, 7, 8, 9 | Monitoring and verification responsibilities and incentives; permanence requirements and reversal management; materiality thresholds, data quality expectations, and uncertainty deductions; leakage scope, metrics, and deduction mechanisms. | Monitoring intervals, verification cycle length, buffer/risk percentages, materiality thresholds, leakage deduction factors. |
| **Non-Carbon Metrics** | 6 | Social and environmental safeguard expectations, stakeholder engagement duties, co-benefit frameworks, and whether price premiums or third-party organisations support safeguards. | Stakeholder engagement timelines, co-benefit scoring systems, premium pricing examples. |

### Additional Cross-Cutting Elements to Capture
- **Versioning & Recent Updates:** Note major revisions that influence current practice (e.g., BC FCOP 2024 changes).
- **Indigenous Rights & Community Engagement:** Explicitly call out requirements for Indigenous consultation where present (aligns with workshop emphasis on social dimensions).
- **Risk Management Instruments:** Tools or calculators (e.g., non-permanence risk tools) that may be useful touchpoints during the workshop exercises.
- **Interoperability with Other Standards:** Where protocols link to complementary schemes (e.g., VCS + CCB, CAR + California Cap-and-Trade), flag connections briefly.

## Next Actions
- Use the four design elements to structure summaries, vulnerabilities, and comparison tables so participants can rapidly compare programmes across consistent themes.
- When analysing protocols, explicitly note how legacy KPI details map into each design element to preserve traceability to the worksheet prompts.
