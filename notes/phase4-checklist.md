# Phase 4 – QA & Packaging Checklist (Draft)

## Consistency & Content QA
- [ ] Re-read all four summaries to ensure tone neutrality, consistent terminology (cross-check with `notes/glossary-cues.md`).
- [ ] Verify key figures (e.g., buffer percentages, monitoring intervals) against source documents during final proof.
- [ ] Confirm comparison table references align with summary wording; add footnotes if needed.

## Formatting & Export
- [ ] Test Markdown → PDF workflow (Pandoc) for each summary and the comparison table; adjust column widths or introduce footnotes if table wraps poorly.
- [ ] Ensure headings, fonts, and spacing are legible for print handouts; evaluate grayscale readability (e.g., bold text vs colour).
- [ ] Compile printable package (summaries, comparison table, glossary) into single PDF; retain Markdown sources in repo.

## Documentation & Handoff
- [ ] Update `notes/roadmap.md` and `notes/research-tracker.md` with final statuses once QA completes.
- [ ] Record final activities in `CHANGE_LOG.md`.
- [ ] Prepare short handoff note summarizing deliverables and any outstanding considerations for workshop facilitation.
